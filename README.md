### What does this do?  
Automatically scrapes Jagex website for OldSchool RuneScape[^2], and procudes a JSON containing various data. The program will create a folder on your desktop named "Crawler Data" where the output files will be saved.


### Format
The contents of the output file are structured as; array followed by object with data points.
```
{
    "Server":
    [
        {worldObject},
        {worldObject}
    ],
    "Stats":
    {
        "abc":391
    }
}
```

### Notes
For this program to work you need to have Java 11 installed.

The output file will be named after the time of the execution in UTC time E.g. "2022-03-23 15-50-00 UTC.json".  
Each resulting file will be around 25kb in size.

Only one instance of the application can run due to mutex. 

__If you wish to close the program you will have to manually close it[^3] through task manager.__


[^2]: The program will automatically scrape every 10 minutes on the 10th minute mark. Which means it will execute every 0-, 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, and 50th minute of the hour.
[^3]: Terminate the process named "Crawler.exe(32-bit)".
